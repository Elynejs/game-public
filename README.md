# Discord Bot Game

This is a rpg-like game made as a bot on discord. It's not made to be publicaly used but you are free to do so if you so desire, just note that you might not understand how to actually make the bot work or what stats are for, I plan to make a github wiki later to go in detail on the game's mechanics.

## How to install

First you must install discord.js, to do that go to your console and type :


*Note that if it is not working you might need to install npm and node.js*

```powershell
npm install discord.js
```

Then, download the bot on github [by clicking this](https://github.com/Elynejs/game-public/archive/master.zip "Download link for the bot") unzip the file somewhere and open a console at the location where you unzipped the file
> you can shift + right-click on the background of the folder to open powershell or open cmd and type cd "the path to your folder"

And type :

```powershell
node index.js
```

__**Don't forget to change the channel ID and the token in the config.json file**__
